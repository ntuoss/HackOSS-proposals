# HackOSS-proposals

Hey Hackers! :sparkles:

We will be hosting NTU Open Source Society's HackOSS Day on Thursday,Â 12 September 2019, 6.30pm at NTU Innovation Center (71 Nanyang Drive #03-01).

## About HackOSS
HackOSS is our homegrown initiative to foster collaborative development of open source projects. If you would like to contribute your tech skills to such projects or learn new things, HackOSS is perfect for you. No technical experience is required *Subject to project owner's discretion*. You will be joining a tech team to learn the latest tools and frameworks collaborating with both experienced and rookie developers. Also, you will have 100% ownership over your project!


The community has always been very welcoming and friendly with this initiative, and so we hope to give our members, especially those who are passionate in sharing their expertise and those who are always in the lookout to learn new things, a good glimpse of the many many things that can be achieved through Open Source collaboration.

## Call for Proposals
We invite all those with an idea to propose their own tech projects and be part of HackOSS Cohort 2 by submitting your proposal [here](https://forms.gle/Biv3Vj9Qe2qriVNV7). We will invite you to share with everyone your ideas this Friday if you get shortlisted (you will receive an email from us).

## Submission of Proposals
If you feel like, you could also send a pull request to the repository to add your proposals in markdown format.
